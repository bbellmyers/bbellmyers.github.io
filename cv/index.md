# Bruce Bell\-Myers

## Summary

I have designed and implemented the client architecture for several enterprise, large\-scale systems, with more than 20 years of experience in building enterprise applications, user interface and human factor engineering\. My concentration for the last several years has been web\-based user interfaces, using HTML / CSS / JavaScript and Java, especially in JavaScript, using libraries such as Angular, React, jQuery and Ext\-JS, with REST\-ful data sources on the server\. In addition, I have extensive knowledge of information architecture, professional graphic design and web\-based multimedia\.

I believe I possess excellent leadership, team\-building, presentation and communication skills\. Some of the clients I have had the pleasure to work with include Standard & Poor, Union Bank of California, US Bank, Wells Fargo, Minnesota Life, Cargill, Musicland \(Sam Goody\), via World Network and Infomarkets\.com\.

I am currently employed at PTC as a Senior Technical Consultant\. I continue to be active in investigating cutting edge user interface technologies and using these to create interfaces which are both visually and technically elegant\.

## Specialties

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript \(Angular, React, Web Components(Stencil, Polymer), Webpack, Babel, ES6\), AJAX, REST, Java 8, JSP, Scrum, Agile, XP, Team Leadership, Enterprise Web Applications, IoT, Node\.js, Redux

## Goal

Seeking a position which provides me opportunities to lead by example, mentor others in best practices, and break new ground using cutting edge technologies, while helping improve the user experience of enterprise scale web applications\.

## Experience

### Senior Web Developer at Healthpartners December 2018 \- Present

Lead a team focused on delivering a component library based on an in-house design system, based
on W3C Web Components, Stencil and Storybook.js. Components are created in close collaboration
with the UX and a11y teams to create accessible and responsive components which define and defend
the visual and interaction patterns defined by the design system.

### Senior Technical Consultant at PTC December 2011 \- November 2018

I provide hands\-on technical and agile process leadership on a small team creating the web and mobile interfaces for enterprise products\.

I am currently working on a massive client upgrade for the FlexPLM product, which provides robust PLM capabilities to retail customers\. The current product is implemented as a customization of the Windchill product, using Java 8 and JSPs to generate user interface\.

My task was to create a new client approach which would modernize the UI and support the new PTC design system from the UX group\. I am also contributing to an effort to implement an atomic design system in\-house which flows from initial concepts in the UX and visual design groups to a collection of fully functional complex widgets, best practices and code examples\.

I prototyped and am now helping to implement a set of user interface widgets which implement the visual concepts of the design system, using Polymer 2 web components\. The widgets are then provided as an npm library which can be used directly as custom tags in JavaScript apps, or wrapped for PTC's Thingworx product, so that the look and feel of apps are consistent whether they are custom coded or generated using Thingworx Mashup Builder\.

The new FlexPLM client is implemented with Angular 6, using the Polymer widgets in component templates as required, and accessing the legacy FlexPLM system via RESTful APIs over AJAX\. Mashups from Thingworx will be strategically included in the new client, where Thingworx functionality is advantageous to users\. This new client will manage local state with the ngRX Redux implementation\.

### Principal Software Engineer at PTC May 2007 \- December 2011 \(4 years 8 months\)

Team lead on the Client Architecture team, primarily focused on client technologies, such as CSS, DHTML, AJAX and JSON, along a Java\-based enterprise infrastructure, based upon J2EE; JSP & Java Beans with Tomcat and Apache HTTPd server, using Ext\-JS for data grids and other JavaScript driven user interface components\.

Served as Scrum master, helping PTC adopt a truly agile approach to developing software\.

### Team Lead, UI Development at US Bank 2001 \- 2007 \(7 years\)

### Director, User Interface Guild 1998 \- 2001 \(4 years\)

### User Interface Designer at Perficient 1998 \- 2001 \(4 years\)

### Software Engineer at Andersen Consulting 1996 \- 1998 \(3 years\)

### Software Engineer 1996 \- 1998 \(3 years\)

## Education

### State University of New York College at Purchase Bachelor of Fine Arts, Acting, 1982 \- 1986

### University of St\. Thomas
